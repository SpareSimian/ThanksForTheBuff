# Thanks for the Buff

Original addon by Runew0lf. Adapted for retail by ScratchMonkey.

From https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/thanks-for-the-buff

Don't you just hate it when someone Buffs you and you have to thank them individually?

Not any more, with Thanks For The Buff, whenever someone buffs you with a useful buff you will now automatically /cheer at the Caster.

This will only trigger now when you get buffs "In the wild" and not when triggered by party members or raid members.

Support is available at https://discord.gg/runew0lf
